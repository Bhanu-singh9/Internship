                The sky was painted in shades of gold and crimson as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the quiet streets. A gentle breeze rustled the leaves, carrying with it the faint scent of jasmine from a nearby garden. Somewhere in the distance, a dog barked lazily, as if protesting the day’s end. <br> It was one of those rare evenings when time seemed to slow down,<br> inviting anyone who noticed to simply pause and breathe.
